/**
 * class MyGraph. Will use Matrix to represent a simple weighted directed graph. There is no loop at vertex.
 * No more than one edge from vertex i to another vertex j. The vertices are numbered as 1, 2, ..., n
 * The graph with n vertices is reprented by an (n+1) by (n+1) matrix with row 0 and column 0 unused.
 * If there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j (i != j), then entry on row i column j of the matrix will 
 * be 1. If there is no edge between vertex i to vertex j (i != j), then the entry on row i column j of the 
 * matrix will be Integer.MAX_VALUE
